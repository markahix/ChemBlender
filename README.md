#### ChemBlender
 *A Python Module for Blender*

This module is designed to work in the python interpreter inside Blender (developed with 3.3.0) to allow importing of computational chemistry file formats and subsequent conversion to Blender objects, materials, animation keyframes, and other things.

**The current version** can import Molden files and parse the atomic positions, then generate a Licorice-style (stick) representation of the molecule therein.
